# Navigation Fixes Implementation Summary

## Problem Identified
The InternDashboard subpages (InternDashboard-1.jsx, InternDashboard-2.jsx, InternDashboard-3.jsx, and InternDashboard-4.jsx) had their own sidebar navigation buttons, but they were not connected to the NavigationContext. This prevented users from navigating between pages from these subpages.

## Solution Implemented
Updated all four subpages to use the shared `InternLayout` component instead of their own sidebar implementations, ensuring consistent navigation functionality across all pages.
